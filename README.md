Welcome to you all !

This [GitHub page](https://hm-ai.github.io/Systematic_Trading_Strategies_with_Machine_Learning_Algorithms/) contains the materials for the course "Systematic Trading Strategies with Machine Learning Algorithms" at Imperial College Business College.

# **Getting Started**

* The scripts are written as Jupyter notebooks and run directly in Google Colab.

* If you prefer to run the scripts on your machine, please follow the instructions in the following link: [Installation instruction](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1GtAF3kuPGDhxRYacLVUMm5S8f1uBA_oM?usp=sharing)


# **Syllabus**


| Lecture | Theory | Programming Session |
|---------|--------|---------------------|
| **[Lecture 1](Lectures/Lecture_1.pdf):**<br>*Introduction to Systematic Strategies with Machine Learning* | - Introducing systematic strategies using machine learning, covering labeling methods, evaluation metrics, feature importance analysis, and hyperparameter optimization tailored for sequential data.<br>- Introducing the Meta-labeling approach, which strategically balances recall and precision by identifying conditions under which a primary model yields optimal trading performance. | [Practical session on financial data labeling for trend detection](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1mX89yYXrN4KNY5zL6G893Z2X5WiRIcHg?usp=sharing) |
| **Lecture 2:**<br>*Unsupervised Learning and Clustering Techniques* | - Introducing clustering algorithms and dimensionality reduction techniques, highlighting their role in addressing substitution effects in feature importance analysis. | - Improving machine learning model performance by reducing substitution effects among correlated features using cluster-level feature importance analysis. |
| **Lecture 3:**<br>*Database Management for Financial Data* |  | - This programming-focused lecture covers database management fundamentals.<br>- The data will be used for subsequent parts of the course. |
| **Lecture 4:**<br>*Supervised Learning Algorithms* | - Overview of key supervised learning algorithms with emphasis on ensemble models (Bagging and Boosting) and feature importance analysis.<br>- Introducing Gated Residual Networks (GRN) and Variable Selection Networks (VSN). | - Forecasting time series with gradient boosting. |
| **Lecture 5:**<br>*Enhancing Strategy Performance in Crypto Markets* |  | - Applying concepts from previous sessions to filter out non-profitable trades from a primary model proposed on crypto data, using a tree-based secondary model with an emphasis on cluster-level feature importance analysis. |
| **Lecture 6:**<br>*Latent Variable Models in Financial Asset Regime Detection* | - Introducing Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) for predicting financial market regimes. | - Implementation of the HMM in a simple case of discrete observations. |
| **Lecture 7:**<br>*Neural Networks for Interpretable Time Series Forecasting* | - Exploration of neural network models for interpretable time series forecasting, including GRUs, LSTMs, N-Beats and Transformers. | - Coding a Transformer from scratch. |
| **Lecture 8:**<br>*Volatility Forecasting with Temporal Fusion Transformers* |  | - In-depth exploration of sequential neural network architectures for predicting volatility, focusing on the replication of the Temporal Fusion Transformer study, and evaluating its performance against the models discussed in earlier sessions. |
| **Lecture 9:**<br>*Review* | - Mock exam and revision elements to prepare for the final exam. |  |
